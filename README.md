# Collatzer
### **A program created to visualize and simulate a user-given value for *N* and see what happens when it is put under the Collatz function.**
## **Basic Info**
### Created by: Zhean Ganituen (Z1aaan)
### Started: October 29, 2021
### Finished: ~
### Github Repo: https://github.com/Z1aaan/Collatzer

## **How To**
#### Simply execute the `collatzer_main.py`
#### Then, type what you want for the value of *N*
#### If you want to export it as a LaTeX file, then input `Y`, when the program asks you if you want to export it. 

## **Requirements**
#### - Python
#### - LaTeX or TeX 
#### -- Through LaTeX distributions like: MikTex, TeX Live, etc. (I use [MikTex](https://miktex.org/))
#### -- Or through online LaTeX editors like overleaf, [here](https://www.overleaf.com/).
#### - Perl *(I think)* (I use [Strawberry Pearl](https://strawberryperl.com/)) 

## Future
#### Maybe I'll add a way for you to also export and embed it into HTML format, using HTML and KaTeX.
#### Maybe I'll add a shorter more compressed output for people who don't want to see the whole `PATH`.
