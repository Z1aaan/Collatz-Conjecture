# Collatzer
### **A program created to visualize and simulate a user-given value for *N* and see what happens when it is put under the Collatz function.**
## **Basic Info**
### Created by: Zhean Ganituen (zrygan)
### Created on: October 29, 2021
### Last Updated: November 2, 2021
### Github Repo: https://github.com/zrygan/Collatzer

## **How To**
#### Simply execute the `collatzer_main.py`
#### Then, type what you want for the value of *N*
#### If you want to export it as a LaTeX (or .txt) file, then input `Y`, when the program asks you if you want to export it. 
#### You can also execute the `collatzer_rng.py` if you want a randomly generated input (with the given) `min` and `max`, then you can chooce to import the randomly generated number to `collatzer_main.py` in `collatzer_rng.py` itself
### **First Open:**
#### On your first open, the program will ask you what the folder path is for latex_outputs. Simply copy the path for this folder then input in the program.
#### *Note:* No need to duplicate the `\`, the program will automatically duplicate it for you.

## **Requirements**
#### - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
#### - LaTeX or TeX 
#### -- Through LaTeX distributions like: MikTex, TeX Live, etc. (I use [MikTex](https://miktex.org/))
#### -- Or through online LaTeX editors like [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
#### - Perl *(I think)* (I use [Strawberry Pearl](https://strawberryperl.com/)) 

## **Common Errors**
#### 1. When inputting the file name, there is no need to input the file type (the program will automatically append it for you).

## Future
#### Maybe I'll add a way for you to also export and embed it into HTML format, using HTML and KaTeX.
#### Maybe I'll add a shorter more compressed output for people who don't want to see the whole `PATH`.

## Other Notes
#### BTW, It is **safe** to delete the `sample_output.tex` and the `other_samples` folder if you want to.
